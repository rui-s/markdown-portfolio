*Write out some* of your **awesome** attributes, and use **emphasis _(like bold or italics)_** to identify keywords, programming languages, or skills.

here's an example of some `code` to run in a separated project

``` c#
public int Multiply()
{
  if(object.Like)
  {
    return 100;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
